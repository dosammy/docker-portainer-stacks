# "ready-to-use" docker-compose files

## Hello everyone.
At first: I'm not a professional programmer. So the files can include some errors and can be improved, but in my environment it works.<br>
I hope I can help someone else with the same problems to deploy (this) stacks in portainer.<br>
All files are portainer stack or docker-compose files you can use "out-of-the-box". The only thing to do at first is creating the networks. All other things will do compose for you. <br>
**I don't recommend** to just copy and paste. You have to change some environment variables.
